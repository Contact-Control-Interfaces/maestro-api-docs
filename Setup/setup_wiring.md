# Headset Wiring

Using wired gloves, a USB splitter is required to power and run the gloves. Depending on the choice of headset, the recommended splitter configuration can change. Due to this, a USB splitter is not included and choice is up to the development team. However, here are our recommendations:

## Valve Index Headset
Recommended Materials:
* [USB splitter](https://www.microcenter.com/product/462631/usb-31-gen-1-(type-a)-4-port-hub)
* Velcro
* Zip ties (optional)
* [USB extension cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Extension-Cable-Male-Female/dp/B00NH12O5I/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=usb+3.0+extension+cable&qid=1565719800&s=gateway&sr=8-4)

Setup:
1. Take USB splitter and stick one side of Velcro it in and the other side of the Velcro to a desired location on the plastic headset headband (pictured is a Windows MR Headset but similar setup is possible with Valve Index).
    * We typically prefer placing it offset from the center-back so that it does not interfere with the tightening knob of the headset. See below for example image.

2. Remove USB Extension Cable and attach to USB splitter
    * For convenience, if you wrap the cord around the power cords of the headset, it can make general transport and setup easier. See below for example images.
    * Doubling each cord back at the attachment point like in the left image can aid in preventing the cords from accidentally being pulled apart.
    * For added security, using zip ties like the one near the bottom of the right image can keep the cords together.

## HTC VIVE Pro
Recommended Materials:
* [USB splitter](https://www.microcenter.com/product/462631/usb-31-gen-1-(type-a)-4-port-hub)
* Velcro
* Zip ties (optional)
* [USB-C to USB adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UUBQ0U8?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_ab-sx-bia_k4_1_6&crid=35H2F3QGW4SUA&sprefix=usb%20c)

Setup:
1. Access the HTC VIVE Pro spare USB-C port and plug in the USB-C to USB Adapter [via these instructions.](https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive-pro-hmd/category_howto/connecting-a-usb-device.html)
2. Plug USB Splitter into the free end of the USB C to USB Adapter. Zip ties can be used to clean up and secure connection.

## HTC Vive
Recommended Materials:
* [USB splitter](https://www.microcenter.com/product/462631/usb-31-gen-1-(type-a)-4-port-hub)
* Velcro
* Zip ties (optional)
* [USB extension cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Extension-Cable-Male-Female/dp/B00NH12O5I/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=usb+3.0+extension+cable&qid=1565719800&s=gateway&sr=8-4)

Setup (Option 1):
1. Take 4-Port USB 3.0 Splitter out of the box and feed it through the loops on the back of the headset.

    * If you prefer, you could attach via Velcro to the fabric strap, but that may make putting the headset on more difficult.
    * If you are using the HTC VIVE with the Deluxe Audio Strap, attaching via Velcro to a plastic region near the back of the head should be suitable.
2. Remove USB 3.0 Extension Cable and attach to 4-Port USB 3.0 splitter
    * For convenience, if you wrap the cord around the power cords of the headset, it can make general transport and setup easier. See below for example images.
    * Doubling each cord back at the attachment point like in the left image can aid in preventing the cords from accidentally being pulled apart.
    * For added security, using zip ties like the one near the bottom of the right image can keep the cords together.

Setup (Option 2):
You can utilize the spare USB port. [Gaining access via these instructions.](https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive/category_howto/connecting-a-usb-device.html)
* NOTE: There is limited space with the compartment on the headset so closing the cover after inserting the USB splitter may be difficult, if not impossible, depending on USB splitter choice
