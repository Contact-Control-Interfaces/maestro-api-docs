# Maestro Setup for Leap Motion

## Prerequisites
If you are using a wired Maestro device, [see this guide for our recommendations for wiring to your headset.](https://contact-control-interfaces.github.io/maestro-sdk-docs/Setup/setup_wiring)

Attaching a USB-splitter to your headset will make attaching the Leap Motion more convenient as well.

## Setup
