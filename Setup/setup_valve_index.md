# Maestro Setup for Valve Index Controllers

## Prerequisites
Using wired gloves, a USB splitter is required to power and run the gloves. Depending on the choice of headset, the recommended splitter configuration can change. Due to this, a USB splitter is not included and choice is up to the development team. However, here are our recommendations:

### Valve Index Headset
Recommended Materials:
* [USB splitter](https://www.microcenter.com/product/462631/usb-31-gen-1-(type-a)-4-port-hub)
* Velcro
* Zip ties (optional)
* [USB extension cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Extension-Cable-Male-Female/dp/B00NH12O5I/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=usb+3.0+extension+cable&qid=1565719800&s=gateway&sr=8-4)

Setup:
1. Take USB splitter and stick one side of velcro it in and the other side of the velcro to a desired location on the plastic headset headband (pictured is a Windows MR Headset but similar setup is possible with Valve Index).
    * We typically prefer placing it offset from the center-back so that it does not interfere with the tightening knob of the headset. See below for example image.

2. Remove USB Extension Cable and attach to USB splitter
    * For convenience, if you wrap the cord around the power cords of the headset, it can make general transport and setup easier. See below for example images.
    * Doubling each cord back at the attachment point like in the left image can aid in preventing the cords from accidentally being pulled apart.
    * For added security, using zip ties like the one near the bottom of the right image can keep the cords together.

### HTC VIVE Pro
Recommended Materials:
* [USB splitter](https://www.microcenter.com/product/462631/usb-31-gen-1-(type-a)-4-port-hub)
* Velcro
* Zip ties (optional)
* [USB-C to USB adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UUBQ0U8?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_ab-sx-bia_k4_1_6&crid=35H2F3QGW4SUA&sprefix=usb%20c)

Setup:
1. Access the HTC VIVE Pro spare USB-C port and plug in the USB-C to USB Adapter [via these instructions.](https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive-pro-hmd/category_howto/connecting-a-usb-device.html)
2. Plug USB Splitter into the free end of the USB C to USB Adapter. Zip ties can be used to clean up and secure connection.

### HTC Vive
Recommended Materials:
* [USB splitter](https://www.microcenter.com/product/462631/usb-31-gen-1-(type-a)-4-port-hub)
* Velcro
* Zip ties (optional)
* [USB extension cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Extension-Cable-Male-Female/dp/B00NH12O5I/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=usb+3.0+extension+cable&qid=1565719800&s=gateway&sr=8-4)

Setup (Option 1):
1. Take 4-Port USB 3.0 Splitter out of the box and feed it through the loops on the back of the headset.

    * If you prefer, you could attach via Velcro to the fabric strap, but that may make putting the headset on more difficult.
    * If you are using the HTC VIVE with the Deluxe Audio Strap, attaching via velcro to a plastic region near the back of the head should be suitable.
2. Remove USB 3.0 Extension Cable and attach to 4-Port USB 3.0 splitter
    * For convenience, if you wrap the cord around the power cords of the headset, it can make general transport and setup easier. See below for example images.
    * Doubling each cord back at the attachment point like in the left image can aid in preventing the cords from accidentally being pulled apart.
    * For added security, using zip ties like the one near the bottom of the right image can keep the cords together.

Setup (Option 2):
You can utilize the spare USB port. [Gaining access via these instructions.](https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive/category_howto/connecting-a-usb-device.html)
* NOTE: There is limited space with the compartment on the headset so closing the cover after inserting the USB splitter may be difficult, if not impossible, depending on USB splitter choice

## Setup
1. For easier overall setup, use the following instructions to first place the Maestro gloves on and adjust for proper fit before putting on and adjusting the headset.
2. Connect Power Cords to fully charged batteries and slide batteries into battery pouch with cord hanging out.
3. Securely close the battery pouch via velcro.
4. Plug the micro-USB into the back of each glove housing.
5. Loosen Valve Index controllers by pressing the button and pulling the strap away from the controllers center.

6. Slide right hand into the sleeve of the Right Maestro glove until each finger is properly aligned within its respective portion of the glove. Make sure each finger cap is tightly snug within the tip of the finger. This is critical for properly feeling the finger-tip based haptics.
7. Pull tab of the strap tight until the strap is tight and the housing feels secure on the top of your arm. 
8. Pull the tab down and secure via velcro.

9. Plug the second end of the Maestro USB Cable into a free port on the USB Splitter on the headset.
10. Slide Valve Index Controllers onto hand until fabric is comfortably on the back of your hand.
11. Pull cord to tighten controllers
    * A snug fit will allow you to open your fingers off of the controller and it will remain firmly attached to your hand.

12. Repeat steps 5-11 with the Left Maestro glove.
13. Power on each respective Valve Index controller. 
14. After securely putting on both Maestro gloves, plug the Power Cords into the back of each gloveâ€™s housing.
15. Place the headset on your head.
16. Once done with experience, gloves can be taken off by:
    * Unplugging the Power Cords.
    * Taking off and setting down the Valve Index Controllers by pressing the button and loosening the cord.
    * Undoing the glove armband velcro strap. 
    * Pulling on the fingertips to remove the glove entirely.
