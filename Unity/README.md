# Maestro Unity SDK Guide

The Unity SDK can be downloaded from [the Contact CI website](https://contactci.co).

The SDK contains:
- Prefabs for the left and right arm that come fully rigged with motion capture, vibration haptics, force-feedback, gesture recognition, and pick-up logic.  
- Menus and Utilities for glove calibration, gesture recording, and general settings.
- Prefabifier utility for using custom arm or hand assets.

You can also find a minimal example project here, containing virtual reality and non-VR example scenes.

## Setup

## Functionality

Aspects of the Maestro's functionality can be used independently, or you can use the default arm prefabs which contain all functionality.

### Motion Capture

Motion capture is controlled by scripts on the appropriate segments of the hand and fingers that set the rotation for that joint. The properly script hierarchy can be seen below:



### Vibration Haptics

### Force Feedback

### Gestures

### Pick Up Logic
